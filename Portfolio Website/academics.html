      <h2>Nice sweet beginnings...</h2>

      That's my school: Loreto Day School, Elliot Road in Kolkata.<br>
      I studied there from nursery till class 10. Before JEE struck my life.<br>
      It's a sweet small school located in Central Kolkata, just off Park Street.<br>
      I gave my ICSE from this school and was the ICSE topper of my batch 0f 2017<br>
      This place has been the site of some of my best memories....
